# Minesweeper-Game

In this project, I created a Minesweeper game using C++ and SFML for graphics. The `Board` class manages the game's grid, including its dimensions, mine placement, and user interactions. The `Tile` class represents each square on the grid, handling states like revealed, flagged, or containing a bomb. The game also includes features like a leaderboard for top scores, a timer, and functionalities for resetting and pausing. Overall, the structure allows for smooth gameplay and accurate representation of classic Minesweeper mechanics.
